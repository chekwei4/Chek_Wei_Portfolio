      <description>Overview The dataset is related to red variant of the Portuguese &amp;ldquo;Vinho Verde&amp;rdquo; wine, which contains physicochemical of 1599 records of red wines. Initially, dataset included a dependent feature [quality], which is a score between 0 to 10. The higher the score, the better the wine. However, most of the scores are concentrated between 5 or 6.
Project has turned this into a classification problem, by setting an arbitrary cutoff for wine quality of 7 and higher classified as &amp;lsquo;good/1&amp;rsquo; and the remainder as &amp;lsquo;bad/0&amp;rsquo;.</description>
